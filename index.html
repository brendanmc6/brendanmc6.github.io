          Born in SoCal, studied in NorCal, currently living in Germany. I am proud to have a diverse, multi-disciplinary and international background with a range of technical and non-technical skills and experiences.
          This includes several thousand hours combined experience with ArcGIS, QGIS, and Excel; some basic programming knowledge (Python/ArcPy, CSS & HTML); and plenty of public presentation, workshop, and writing experience.

      <div class="content card-3">In CSS, by default, the width and height you assign to an element is applied only to the element's content box. If the element has any border or padding, this is then added to the width and height to arrive at the size of the box that's rendered on the screen. This means that when you set width and height you have to adjust the value you give to allow for any border or padding that may be added. This is especially tricky when implementing a responsive design.</div>
