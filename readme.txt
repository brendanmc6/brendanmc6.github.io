master is the live website branch. Changes should be first saved to prototype and tested in the browser.

The project folder is in ./Google Drive/GitHub/brendanmc6.github.io/

To sync to GitHub I have to stage changes in the git panel then push in the github panel.
To go Live, I just merge the pull request from prototype branch to master branch.
